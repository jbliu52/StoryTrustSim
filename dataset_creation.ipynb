They also have knowledge graphs G_i,j for every other person j which represents what person i believes person j knows. So this generalizes your setup a bit in that it's not all or nothing: a person can know some parts of what another person believes but not necessarily everything (or nothing).\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way to look at it could be to create a new kind of \"higher-order\" fact like `believes(sally,likes(alex,jay))` which would have a meaning like \"Sally thinks that Alex likes Jay.\" And instead of having a hierarchy of multiple knowledge graphs, you can just have one knowledge graph per person G_i, except the knowledge graphs can contain facts like `believes(i,e)`. Note that you can have nested logical forms like `believes(sally,believes(jen,likes(alex,jay)))` which would mean \"Sally thinks that Jen thinks that Alex likes Jay.\" This language would have good expressive power since we can make distinctions like: believes(sally,~likes(alex,jay)) which would mean \"Sally believes that Alex does not like Jay,\" vs ~believes(sally,likes(alex,jay)) which would mean \"Sally does not believe that Alex likes Jay\" (notice that the first implies the second but the second doesn't necessarily imply the first). So we can have a rule of inference like: for all i and e, if believes(i,~e) then ~believes(i,e).\n"
