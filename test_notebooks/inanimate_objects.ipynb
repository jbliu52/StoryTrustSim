Wait, when Bob leaves room_4 to go to room_3, the people in room_4 (which was just Bob) would see him leave. But since he was alone, no one else saw that. So others in the hallway don't know where Bob went next unless they were with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the initial note says all characters start in the hallway. So when Bob first enters room_4, he leaves the hallway. The others (Alice, Edward, Danny, Charlie, Frank) are still in the hallway. Then Bob goes to room_3. Since he was in room_4 alone, no one saw him leave to room_3. So the others in the hallway don't know he moved to room_3 unless they later meet him there.\n",

Therefore, Alice would think Bob is still in room_4 (since she didn't see him leave, but when she entered room_4, he wasn't there. Wait, maybe she knows he was there before? Wait, no. If Alice enters room_4 and Bob isn't there, she might not know where he is. But from the hallway, she saw Bob go to room_4 in step 1. Then in step 2, Bob left room_4 to go to room_3, but no one was there to see that. So Alice, upon entering room_4 in step 3, would find that Bob isn't there. But she doesn't know where he went because no one saw him leave room_4. So Alice might think Bob is still in room_4 (since she last saw him go there) but actually he's in room_3. But wait, when Alice enters room_4, she doesn't see Bob, so she might realize he's not there anymore. But she doesn't know where he went. So her knowledge is that Bob was in room_4 (from step 1) but now he's not there, so he could be somewhere else, but she doesn't know where. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The problem says that characters in the same location can see where each other go when someone leaves. So if someone is in a room and leaves, the others present there see where they go. But if someone leaves a room when no one else is there, then no one knows where they went. So in step 2, Bob leaves room_4 alone, so no one knows he went to room_3. Therefore, when Alice enters room_4 in step 3, she doesn't see Bob, so she knows he's not there anymore, but she doesn't know where he went. So Alice's knowledge is that Bob was in room_4 (from step 1) but now he's not there. She can't be sure where he is. But maybe the question isn't about Bob, but let's keep going.\n",

So when Danny enters room_1 at step 11, Frank is already in the hallway. So in room_1 at step 11: Alice and Danny. Also, step 14: Bob enters room_1. So after Danny enters room_1 (step 11), step 14 is Bob entering room_1. Then step 15: Alice leaves to hallway. So Alice was in room_1 from step 5 until step 15 when she leaves. So when Danny enters room_1 (step 11), Alice is there. Then Danny draws a star on the wall (step 12). Then Charlie enters room_2 (step 13). Bob enters room_1 (step 14). Then Alice leaves to hallway (step 15). So during the time Danny is in room_1 (steps 11-22?), let's see when he leaves.\n",

So Alice sees Danny enter the hallway. Then Danny puts his phone down (step 23) and enters room_4 (step 24). So Alice, being in the hallway, sees Danny enter the hallway, then leave to room_4.

Wait, the problem states: \"Characters in the same location can see where each other go when someone leaves.\" So when Danny leaves room_1 to go to the hallway, Charlie and Frank (who are in room_1) can see that Danny went to the hallway.

Therefore, Charlie might not know that Alice is in the hallway. Wait, but characters can only see others' movements if they are in the same location. So when Alice leaves room_1 to go to the hallway (step 15), who is in room_1? At step 15, Alice leaves room_1. The people in room_1 at that time are Danny (entered at step 11), Bob (entered at step 14). So when Alice leaves, Danny and Bob are in room_1 and see her go to the hallway.

So Charlie, upon entering room_1, doesn't see Alice there. Therefore, Charlie would realize that Alice is not in room_1 anymore. But how does he know where she went? Because when Alice left room_1 (step 15), the people in room_1 were Danny and Bob. They saw her go to the hallway. But Charlie wasn't in room_1 at that time.

However, he might infer based on possible movements, but the problem doesn't mention inferences beyond direct observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the question is about Charlie's belief about Alice's belief about Danny's location. So even if Charlie doesn't know where Alice is, he has to assume where Alice thinks Danny is based on what Alice could have known up to the point when they were last together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but when were Charlie and Alice last together in the same location? Let's check:\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was in room_1 from step 5 to step 15. Charlie was in room_1 from step 3 to step 13 (when he left to room_2), then came back to room_1 at step 16. So the last time Charlie and Alice were together in the same location was before step 13. Because Alice was in room_1 until step 15, but Charlie left room_1 at step 13. So when Charlie left room_1 at step 13, Alice was still there. Then, when Charlie comes back to room_1 at step 16, Alice has already left (step 15). Therefore, the last time Charlie saw Alice was when he left room_1 at step 13, and Alice was still in room_1. So from Charlie's perspective, when he left room_1 (step 13), Alice was there. Then, when he returns to room_1 at step 16, Alice is gone. But he doesn't know where she went. So Charlie might assume that Alice is still in room_1 unless he has information to the contrary. But according to the problem's rules, characters can only know others' movements if they were present when they left. Since Charlie wasn't in room_1 when Alice left, he doesn't know she left. Therefore, Charlie might think Alice is still in room_1. But when he enters room_1 again at step 16 and doesn't see her, he would realize she's not there. But according to the problem's rules, does that mean he knows she left, but not where she went? The problem states: \"If characters are in different locations, they cannot see each other.\" So when Charlie enters room_1 at step 16, he can see who is there (Danny and Bob), but doesn't see Alice. Therefore, he knows Alice is not in room_1 anymore. But he doesn't know where she went because he wasn't there when she left. So Charlie knows Alice left room_1 but doesn't know her current location.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the problem is about Charlie's belief about Alice's belief about Danny's location. So Charlie has to model what Alice knows, considering what Alice could have observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's try to reconstruct Alice's knowledge:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Alice was in room_1 from step 5 to step 15.\n",
      "- During that time, Danny entered room_1 at step 11.\n",
      "- Alice left room_1 at step 15 to go to the hallway.\n",
      "- Then, Danny remained in room_1 until step 22, when he left to the hallway.\n",
      "- Alice, being in the hallway from step 15 onwards, saw Danny enter the hallway at step 22, then leave to room_4 at step 24.\n",
      "- Therefore, Alice knows Danny is in room_4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Charlie's belief about Alice's belief:\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie needs to think about what Alice knows. To do this, Charlie would consider what Alice could have observed based on her locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Charlie doesn't know where Alice is after she left room_1. However, if Charlie assumes that Alice stayed in room_1, then Alice would have seen Danny in room_1 until she left. But since Alice actually left to the hallway, and saw Danny move to room_4, but Charlie doesn't know that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, Charlie might realize that Alice could have left room_1, but he doesn't know where she went. Therefore, Charlie has to consider two possibilities: either Alice is still in room_1 (which he knows is not the case because when he returned to room_1, she wasn't there), or she left to some other location. But since he doesn't know where she went, he can't be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the problem's rules, characters can only know others' movements if they were present when they left. Since Charlie wasn't present when Alice left room_1, he doesn't know where she went. Therefore, from Charlie's perspective, Alice could be anywhere, but he knows she's not in room_1 anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to determine where Charlie thinks Alice thinks Danny is, we need to consider what Alice's last known location (from Charlie's perspective) would lead her to believe about Danny.\n",

      "\n",
      "But this is getting complicated. Let's try a different approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's assume that Charlie, not knowing where Alice is, has to base his belief on the last time they were together. The last time Charlie and Alice were together was in room_1 before Charlie left at step 13. At that time, Alice was in room_1, and Danny hadn't entered yet (Danny enters at step 11, which is after Charlie left room_1 at step 13? Wait, no:\n",

      "The steps are in order:\n",

      "So, Charlie is in room_1 from step 3 to step 13 when he leaves to room_2. Alice enters room_1 at step 5. Danny enters room_1 at step 11. So when Danny enters room_1 at step 11, Charlie is still there (since he leaves at step 13). Therefore, Charlie is in room_1 with Alice and Danny from step 11 to step 13. Then Charlie leaves to room_2 at step 13. Alice remains in room_1 until step 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the last time Charlie saw Alice was in room_1 when he left at step 13. At that time, Danny was also in room_1. Then, after Charlie leaves, Alice stays in room_1 until step 15, when she leaves to the hallway. Danny remains in room_1 until step 22.\n",

Therefore, Charlie knows that Alice left room_1 between step 13 and step 16. But he doesn't know where she went because he wasn't there when she left. However, when Charlie returns to room_1 at step 16, he sees Danny there. So Charlie knows that Danny was in room_1 at least until step 16. Then, Danny leaves room_1 at step 22, which Charlie witnesses (since he's in room_1) and sees Danny go to the hallway. But after that, Charlie doesn't know where Danny went.\n",

      "   - Charlie doesn't know where Alice went after leaving room_1.\n",
      "   - However, Charlie knows that Danny was in room_1 until step 22, when he (Charlie) saw Danny leave to the hallway.\n",
      "   - Charlie doesn't know what happened to Danny after that.\n",

But wait, if Alice is in the hallway from step 15 onwards, she would see Danny enter the hallway at step 22 and then go to room_4. But Charlie doesn't know that Alice is in the hallway. So Charlie has to consider two possibilities: either Alice is in a location where she can see Danny's movements after room_1, or she isn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting quite complex. Let's try to simplify.\n",
      "\n",

      "Alternatively, if Charlie knows that Alice left room_1 but doesn't know where she went, he has to consider where she could be.

Therefore, no one in room_4 would know she left except herself. But others in the hallway (Charlie, Frank, Edward) didn't see her enter room_4 or leave because they were in the hallway. Wait, but when Alice entered room_4, she was coming from the hallway. So when she left room_4 to go to room_3, she was in room_4, and the people in the hallway (Charlie, Frank, Edward) couldn't see her because they're in a different location. So no one except Alice knows she went from room_4 to room_3. So others in the hallway don't know where she went after entering room_4. Hmm, but maybe when she first entered room_4, the people in the hallway (Charlie, Frank, Edward) saw her go into room_4. Wait, the initial state is that everyone starts in the hallway. So when Alice enters room_4, she leaves the hallway. So the people in the hallway (Charlie, Frank, Edward) would see her go into room_4. Then, when she leaves room_4 to go to room_3, she's in room_4, and the only people who could see her leave would be those in room_4. But at that time, when she left room_4, was anyone else in room_4? Let's check. After step 3, Alice is in room_4. Then step 4, she leaves room_4 for room_3. At that moment, she was alone in room_4, so no one else was there to see her leave. Therefore, no one knows she went to room_3 except herself. So others in the hallway (Charlie, Frank, Edward) know she went to room_4 but don't know she left. So they might think she's still in room_4 unless they later see her somewhere else. But since she's moving to room_3, which is a different location, unless someone else enters room_3 and sees her there, others wouldn't know. Let's keep that in mind.\n",

So Charlie is in room_4, which Alice had left earlier. So when Charlie enters room_4, he doesn't see Alice there because she already left. So Charlie would think room_4 is empty except for himself, unless someone else was there. But Alice left room_4 before Charlie arrived, so Charlie doesn't know Alice was ever there unless he was told or saw her leave, which he didn't. Wait, but when Alice left room_4, no one was there to see her leave. So Charlie enters room_4 and finds it empty. So he doesn't know Alice was there. But the people in the hallway (Bob, Frank, Edward) saw Alice enter room_4, but not leave. So they might think she's still there unless they later see her elsewhere. But since Alice is in room_3, which is a different location, unless someone else enters room_3 and sees her, others don't know.\n",

Therefore, Alice's knowledge about Charlie's information is limited to what Charlie knew up to the point when they were last together.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alice and Charlie were last together in room_3 (up to step 15), Charlie left to room_4, and at that time, Frank was still in room_3. Alice stayed in room_3 until step 16, then left, leaving Frank there. So from Alice's perspective, when Charlie left room_3, Frank was there.

      "\n",
      "But wait, Alice knows that after she left room_3, Frank could have moved, but she doesn't have any information about that.

      "\n",
      "So Alice's belief about Charlie's belief would depend on what she thinks Charlie could have seen.

When Charlie left room_3 (step 15), Frank was still there. Alice left room_3 in step 16, leaving Frank there. So Alice might think that Charlie, not having seen Frank after that, would believe Frank is still in room_3. But wait, Charlie could have seen Frank in room_4 if Frank moved there.

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, let's try to figure out where Alice thinks Charlie thinks Danny is. This seems a bit complicated with all the characters moving around, so I need to break it down step by step.\n",

      "First, let's recap the story. All characters start in the hallway. Then they move to different rooms as per the sequence given. The key here is that characters can only see each other's movements if they are in the same location. So, if two people are in the same room, they can see where each other goes when someone leaves.

So when Danny leaves room_4 to room_5, there's no one else in room_4 to see him leave. So only Danny knows he went to room_5. Others who were in room_4 (Alice and Charlie) had already left.

So after Alice left room_2, Danny stayed there until step 25. Then he goes to room_3, where Alice is. So when Danny enters room_3 at step 25, Alice is there. So Alice can ask Danny (if they communicate) about where others are, but the problem states that characters can only see where others go when they leave the same location.

So when Danny arrives in room_3, Alice knows he came from room_2. But does Alice know that Danny saw Bob leave room_2? Because if Danny was in room_2 when Bob left, then Danny would know Bob went to room_1, and if Alice and Danny are in room_3 together, maybe Alice can infer from Danny's presence that Bob left room_2 after she did. But the problem states that characters can only see where others go when they leave the same location. So when Bob leaves room_2 to go to room_1 at step 22, Danny is in room_2 and sees that. So Danny knows Bob went to room_1. Then when Danny moves to room_3 at step 25, Alice sees Danny coming from room_2. But does Alice know that Danny knows Bob went to room_1? Not unless they communicate, which the problem doesn't mention. The problem only states that they can see where others go when leaving the same location. So Alice knows that Danny was in room_2 until step 25, but she doesn't automatically know what Danny saw in room_2 unless she was there with him.\n",

However, when Danny comes to room_3 at step 25, Alice knows that Danny was in room_2 until then, but she doesn't know if Bob was still there when Danny left. Unless Danny's arrival in room_3 implies that Bob left earlier, but that's not necessarily the case. Because Danny could have left room_2 even if Bob was still there.\n",

She doesn't have any information after that, unless someone who was in room_2 after her departure comes to her location (room_3) and she can infer based on their movements. Danny comes to room_3 at step 25. When Danny leaves room_2 to go to room_3, Alice sees that. But does that tell her anything about Bob? Only that Danny was in room_2 until step 25. If Bob had left room_2 before Danny, Danny would have seen Bob leave. But Alice doesn't know that unless she can infer from Danny's arrival that Bob must have left earlier. But since the problem doesn't mention communication, only visibility of movements, Alice can't know what Danny saw unless she was present.\n",

However, the problem states that characters in the same location can see where each other go when someone leaves. So when Bob leaves room_2 at step 22 to go to room_1, Danny is in room_2 and sees that. Then when Danny leaves room_2 at step 25 to go to room_3, Alice sees Danny coming from room_2.

But does Alice gain any knowledge from Danny's arrival? The problem doesn't specify that characters share information, only that they can see movements. So Alice knows that Danny was in room_2 until step 25, but she doesn't know what Danny saw in room_2 after she left. Therefore, Alice's knowledge about Bob's location is that he was in room_2 when she left, and she has no further information.

Danny sees Bob go to room_1. Then step 25: Danny leaves to room_3. Alice sees Danny come from room_2 to room_3. So Danny knows that Frank went to room_1 and Bob went to room_1.

Similarly, Frank leaves room_2 at step 20, but Alice doesn't see that. So Alice has no information about Frank's movements after she left room_2. Therefore, from Alice's perspective, Frank could still be in room_2, or he could have moved somewhere else, but she doesn't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the question is about where Alice thinks Frank thinks Bob is. So Alice has to model Frank's knowledge based on what she thinks Frank knows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming Alice believes Frank is still in room_2 (since she doesn't know he left), then Frank would have seen Bob in room_2. But actually, Frank left room_2 at step 20. But Alice doesn't know that. So if Alice thinks Frank is still in room_2, then she would think that Frank thinks Bob is still in room_2, because Frank would have seen Bob there. But wait, Bob left room_2 at step 22, which is after Frank left room_2 at step 20. So Frank was in room_2 until step 20, then Bob leaves at step 22. So Frank was not in room_2 when Bob left. Therefore, Frank doesn't know where Bob went after he (Frank) left room_2.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Alice doesn't know that Frank left room_2. So from Alice's perspective, Frank was in room_2 when she left (step 18), and she doesn't know if he stayed or left. If she assumes he stayed, then Frank would have seen Bob leave room_2 at step 22. But Alice doesn't know that Bob left room_2. So this is getting complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, let's approach it from the end. Where is Bob now? Bob ends up in room_5. But the question is about Alice's belief about Frank's belief. So we need to determine what Alice knows and what she infers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's try to reconstruct Alice's knowledge step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Alice was in room_2 from steps 6-18. During that time, she saw Frank, Edward, Bob, Danny, and Charlie come and go as per the steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "- When Alice was in room_2, she saw Bob enter at step 11 and stay until she left at step 18. So she knows Bob was in room_2 as of her departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "- After she leaves to room_3, she can't see any movements in room_2 unless someone from room_2 comes to room_3 and she sees them arrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Danny enters room_3 at step 25. Alice sees Danny arrive from room_2. So she knows Danny was in room_2 until step 25. But she doesn't know what Danny saw in room_2 after she left.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Therefore, Alice knows that as of step 25, Danny was in room_2. But Bob could have left room_2 before or after that. If Bob left after step 25, then Danny wouldn't have seen it, but Alice doesn't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, Bob leaves room_2 at step 22, which is before Danny leaves at step 25. So when Danny was in room_2 until step 25, he saw Bob leave at step 22. Therefore, Danny knows Bob went to room_1. But Alice doesn't know that unless she infers it from Danny's arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem states that characters can see where others go when they leave the same location. So when Bob leaves room_2 to go to room_1 at step 22, Danny is in room_2 and sees that. Then when Danny leaves room_2 to go to room_3 at step 25, Alice sees Danny arrive from room_2. However, there's no mention of characters sharing information beyond seeing movements. So Alice knows Danny was in room_2 until step 25, but she doesn't automatically know that Danny saw Bob leave to room_1. Unless the act of Danny leaving room_2 implies that Bob wasn't there anymore, but that's not necessarily the case. Danny could leave even if Bob is still there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Alice's knowledge is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bob was in room_2 when she left (step 18).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Danny was in room_2 until step 25, when he came to room_3.\n",
      "\n",
      "- She has no information about Bob's movements after step 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Alice might assume that Bob is still in room_2, or she might think he could have moved, but she has no way of knowing. However, the problem might expect us to assume that characters assume others stay in their last known location unless they have evidence to the contrary.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if Alice thinks that Frank is still in room_2 (since she doesn't know he left), then Frank would have seen Bob leave room_2 at step 22. But wait, Frank left room_2 at step 20, before Bob left at step 22. So Frank wasn't in room_2 when Bob left. Therefore, Frank's last knowledge of Bob is that he was in room_2 when Frank left to room_1 at step 20.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is getting really tangled. Let's try to outline the possible steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Determine Alice's current location: room_3.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Determine where Alice thinks Bob is: She last saw him in room_2. She doesn't have any info after that, so she might think he's still there or moved, but the default assumption is he's still there unless she has evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Determine where Alice thinks Frank is: She last saw Frank in room_2 when she left. She doesn't know he moved to room_1, so she might think he's still in room_2.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Therefore, Alice thinks that Frank is in room_2 and can see Bob's movements. If Bob left room_2 after Alice left, but Frank is still there (in Alice's mind), then Frank would know where Bob went. But since in reality Frank left before Bob, Alice's belief is based on her assumption that Frank is still in room_2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if Alice thinks Frank is still in room_2, then she would think that Frank saw Bob leave room_2 to room_1 at step 22. Therefore, Alice would think that Frank knows Bob is in room_1. But wait, Bob actually leaves room_1 to room_5 at step 24. But Frank is in room_1 from step 20 onwards. So when Bob enters room_1 at step 22, Frank is there. Then Bob leaves room_1 at step 24 to go to room_5. Frank is in room_1 and sees Bob leave to room_5. Therefore, Frank knows Bob is in room_5.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Alice doesn't know any of this. She doesn't know Frank moved to room_1 or that Bob was there. So from Alice's perspective:\n",
      "\n",
      "- She thinks Frank is in room_2.\n",
      "\n",
      "- She thinks Bob was in room_2 when she left, and she doesn't know if he moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "- If she assumes Frank is still in room_2, then Frank would have seen Bob leave room_2 to room_1 at step 22 (if Bob did leave). But Alice doesn't know if Bob left. So her belief depends on whether she thinks Bob stayed or left.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since Alice has no information after step 18, she might assume Bob is still in room_2. Therefore, she would think that Frank (still in room_2) also thinks Bob is in room_2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if Alice considers that Frank might have left room_2 after she did, but she has no info, she might not be sure. But the problem likely expects us to assume that characters believe others stay in their last known location unless they have evidence to the contrary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer would be room_2. But wait, let's check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another angle: When Alice is in room_3, and Danny comes from room_2 to room_3 at step 25. Alice knows that Danny was in room_2 until then. If Bob had left room_2 before Danny, Danny would have seen it, but Alice doesn't know that. However, if Bob was still in room_2 when Danny left, then Danny wouldn't have seen Bob leave. So Alice might think that Bob could still be in room_2, or he could have left after Danny.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the problem doesn't specify that characters make assumptions beyond their direct observations, the safest answer is that Alice thinks Frank thinks Bob is in room_2, because that's the last place Alice saw Bob, and she has no information that Frank or Bob moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, Frank actually moved to room_1, and Bob moved to room_5. But Alice doesn't know that. So from Alice's perspective:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Frank is in room_2 (last seen there).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bob is in room_2 (last seen there).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Alice thinks that Frank, being in room_2, would think Bob is in room_2 because he hasn't left (from Frank's perspective in Alice's mind).\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in reality, Frank left room_2 before Bob did. But Alice doesn't know that. So in Alice's mind, Frank is still in room_2, and if Bob left room_2 after Alice left, Frank would have seen it. But Alice doesn't know if Bob left. So if Alice assumes Bob stayed, then Frank would think Bob is in room_2. If Alice assumes Bob left, but she doesn't know where, she might think Frank knows where Bob went.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem is asking where Alice thinks Frank thinks Bob is. Since Alice doesn't have any information about Bob's movements after she left room_2, and she thinks Frank is still in room_2, she would think that Frank would have seen Bob leave if he did. But since she doesn't know if Bob left, she might assume that Frank still thinks Bob is in room_2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if Alice considers that Frank might have left room_2 after she did, then Frank's knowledge would be based on when he left. But since Alice doesn't know Frank left, she can't account for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is quite tricky. The key is to realize that Alice's belief about Frank's belief depends on what she knows Frank could have seen. Since Alice last saw Frank in room_2, and she doesn't know he left, she assumes he's still there. Therefore, Frank would have seen Bob's subsequent movements in room_2. Bob left room_2 at step 22 to go to room_1. If Frank was still in room_2 (as Alice thinks), then Frank would have seen Bob leave to room_1. Therefore, Alice would think that Frank knows Bob went to room_1. But wait, this contradicts because in reality Frank left room_2 before Bob did, but Alice doesn't know that. So in Alice's mind, Frank is in room_2 and sees Bob leave to room_1. Therefore, Alice thinks Frank thinks Bob is in room_1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, this requires Alice to know that Bob left room_2, which she doesn't. Unless she infers that because Danny came to room_3 from room_2, and maybe Bob left earlier. But this is getting too convoluted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try to summarize:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Alice's knowledge: Bob was in room_2 when she left. Frank was there too. She doesn't know any movements after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "- If she assumes Frank is still in room_2, then Frank would have seen Bob leave to room_1 at step 22. Therefore, Alice would think Frank knows Bob is in room_1.\n",

      "- But Alice doesn't know Bob left room_2. So she might think Bob is still there, and Frank thinks the same.\n",
      "\n",

Since Alice doesn't know that Frank left room_2, she assumes he's still there. Therefore, Frank would have seen Bob leave to room_1 at step 22. Therefore, Alice would think that Frank thinks Bob is in room_1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, how does Alice know that Bob left room_2? She doesn't, unless she infers it from Danny's arrival.

So unless she can assume that if Bob were still in room_2, Danny would have mentioned it or something, but the problem doesn't allow for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem states that characters can see others' movements when in the same location. So when Bob leaves room_2 to go to room_1, Danny (in room_2) sees that. When Danny later goes to room_3, Alice sees Danny come from room_2 but doesn't gain any knowledge about Bob's location unless Danny's movement implies something.
